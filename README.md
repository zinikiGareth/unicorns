unicorns
========

This is an attempt to work out how to do "real" cards in the land of unicorns and blueberries.

It starts from Chris' Tse's original deck about cards and expense reports from Sep 2012.

It uses the full conductor/ember/Ziniki stack in both Chrome and node.js to deliver the value.
